About Me
--------

I am a PhD student at the
[Department of Computer Science](http://cs.york.ac.uk) at the
[University of York](http://york.ac.uk). My research interests are in
the area of formal methods and software verification, particularly
with the formalisms Z, CSP and [Circus](http://cs.york.ac.uk/circus).

My current research is on verification of virtual machines for
Safety-Critical Java (SCJ). SCJ is a variant of Java designed to
facilitate the creation of certifiable real-time systems. There has
been work on verification of SCJ programs in the
[hiJaC project](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/circus/hijac) and its areas
of application include robotics, making it a good implementation
language for the ongoing
[RoboCalc project](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/circus/RoboCalc). I am
working on modelling of an SCJ virtual machine in the Circus
specification language and and verification of a compilation strategy
from Java bytecode to C to permit native execution of SCJ programs.
