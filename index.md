About Me
--------

I am a research associate at the [Department of Computer
Science](http://cs.york.ac.uk) at the [University of
York](http://york.ac.uk). My research interests are in the area of
formal methods and software verification, particularly with the
formalisms Z, CSP and [Circus](http://cs.york.ac.uk/circus).

My current research is on developing a formal testing strategy for
robot software as part of the RoboTest project, on which I began work
as a research associate in July 2018. This is part of the wider
[RoboStar](http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/robostar) group of projects and
focuses on model-based test case development using the graphical
specification notation
[RoboChart](https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/robostar/notations-tools).
During this, I have extended the semantics of RoboChart to distinguish
inputs and outputs, and developed a strategy to extract timed test
cases. I am currently working to develop a language called RoboWorld
to describe the environment of a robot. My current focus is defining
the semantics of RoboWorld using a hybrid variant of Circus called
CyPhyCircus, and working to apply hybrid model checkers to allow
checking of the semantics.

I completed my PhD at the University of York in January 2019, with a
thesis entitled [Ahead-of-time Algebraic Compilation for
Safety-Critical Java](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/22698/),
supervised by Ana Cavalcanti. My PhD research looked at verification
of virtual machines for Safety-Critical Java (SCJ), a variant of Java
designed to facilitate the creation of certifiable real-time systems.
I worked on modelling of an SCJ virtual machine in the Circus
specification language and and verification of a compilation strategy
from Java bytecode to C to permit native execution of SCJ programs.
