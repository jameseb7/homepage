About Me
--------

I am a PhD student at the
[Department of Computer Science](http://cs.york.ac.uk) at the
[University of York](http://york.ac.uk). My research interests are in
the area of formal methods and software verification, particularly
with the formalisms Z, CSP and [Circus](http://cs.york.ac.uk/circus).
My current research is on formal modelling of a virtual machine for
Safety-Critical Java (SCJ) and verification of a compilation strategy
from Java bytecode to C to permit native execution of SCJ programs.
