<p>I am a research associate at the <a href="http://cs.york.ac.uk">Department of Computer
Science</a> at the <a href="http://york.ac.uk">University of
York</a>. My research interests are in the area of
formal methods and software verification, particularly with the
formalisms Z, CSP and <a href="http://cs.york.ac.uk/circus">Circus</a>.</p>

<p>My current research is on developing a formal testing strategy for
robot software as part of the RoboTest project, on which I began work
as a research associate in July 2018. This is part of the wider
<a href="http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/robostar">RoboStar</a> group of projects and
focusses on model-based test case development using the graphical
specification notation
<a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/robostar/notations-tools">RoboChart</a>. I am
working on extending the semantics of RoboChart to distinguish inputs
and outputs, and using that information to extract timed test cases.</p>

<p>I completed my PhD at the University of York in January 2019, with a
thesis entitled <a href="http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/22698/">Ahead-of-time Algebraic Compilation for
Safety-Critical Java</a>,
supervised by Ana Cavalcanti. My PhD research looked at verification
of virtual machines for Safety-Critical Java (SCJ), a variant of Java
designed to facilitate the creation of certifiable real-time systems.
I worked on modelling of an SCJ virtual machine in the Circus
specification language and and verification of a compilation strategy
from Java bytecode to C to permit native execution of SCJ programs.</p>
